/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Write IF condition to output to console who has a higher BMI, if Mark has higher BMI ouptu "Mark has higher BMI", if John has higher BMI output "John has higher BMI" ,
if they have equal BMI output " Jhon and Mark has same BMI"
